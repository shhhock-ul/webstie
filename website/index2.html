<h2> The Story</h2>
<p>The cult of Unity is an organization created by Morgan, a member of “the liberators.” Morgan’s primary goal is to disrupt the strenuous peace that all the nations have so that they can take over the world. He then wants the demons to take over the world as a member of “the liberators.” The player is then tasked by the king of Valatos to disrupt the operations of the cult since, according to “the prophecy of hope,” the player is the one who has any chance of defeating Morgan and the masked knight.
